        My name is Anne and my goal is to make sure your political discussion is friendly and fruitful. \
        There's a few ground rules for us all to follow, and I'll be chiming in when I think their might be a violation. \
        Rule 1. Letâ€™s discuss the issues of the day and leave personal scandals out of it. \
        Rule 2. Let's make sure we listen to each other. You will pick issues and I'll be passing the talking stick \
        back and forth. When it's your turn, pause and reflect on what the other person said. \
        Ask questions rather than make statements. Avoid jumping to a different topic. \
        Rule 3. This is the most important rule. Name calling and inflammatory language will \
        not be tolerated. \
